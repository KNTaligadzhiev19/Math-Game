## About
> Our team has made the game Moscow chess. This is a game that develops strategic thinking and is suitable for all ages. It is played with 2 players which choose who will play with X and O, alternating who is on the move on a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The winner is the player who manages to place three of his points horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
